Description:
An ambitious Zombies gamemode used for Infected. One player is infected as a zombie and tries to infect the other survivors. It features a round system tied to zombie lives. Each zombie gets an amount of lives and, once used up, puts them in a "zombie jail" to wait for the rest of the zombies to die and for the new round to start. The survivors can get new weapons from a weapon box, use a gambler to get random rewards, and upgrade their gun up to two times. This script became very complex near the end and as a result behaves oddly in many circumstances. Be aware of potential bugs.
